next hw:
last chance to come with previous assignments
fix everything
oracle is more important
next week:
hash indexes - look up for postgres think where we can use it and make an example

functional indexes - both oracle and postgres(possibly)
 - not on a single column or a group of columns but ones created on expressions
 - very specialized
 - come up with a query where such index would help and add it
